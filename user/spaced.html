Jesus used this as a lesson, symbolizing how Israel, despite having the appearance of spiritual fruitfulness, was not producing the kind of faith and righteousness that God desired. The cursing of the fig tree was a symbolic act, showing the judgment on those who outwardly appear faithful but lack true fruitfulness in their lives."

This event marked the end of the Babylonian Captivity, which had lasted about 70 years.\n\nCyrus' policy of religious tolerance and restoration of displaced peoples was part of his broader strategy to stabilize his newly acquired empire. The Cyrus Cylinder, an ancient Persian artifact, also confirms his approach to allowing exiled groups to return to their homelands."

These brushes are responsible for feeding the current produced in the armature coil to the external circuit via wires. \nEnergy Source: The armature coil is rotated about its axis with the help of a turbine.

But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.\"\n\nIn Midian, Moses encountered the daughters of the priest of Midian, who introduced him to their father, Jethro (also known as Reuel). Moses eventually married one of Jethro's daughters, Zipporah, and settled there, tending to Jethro's flocks. This period in Midian lasted for about 40 years before God called Moses to return to Egypt and lead the Israelites out of slavery."

The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.\"\n\nIn this context, Ezekiel addresses a common proverb of his time that suggested children suffered for their parents' sins. He refutes this notion, asserting that each person is accountable for their own behavior. This teaching underscores the principle of personal responsibility and divine justice, indicating that individuals will face consequences for their own sins, not for the sins of others."
